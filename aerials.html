        <h1>Aerials:</h1>
            <div class="head-text">
                <p class="head-text">In cardistry, aerials are advanced techniques where a packet or multiple packets of cards are launched into the air and manipulated with the hands before being caught or reassembled. Unlike traditional card flourishes that involve keeping the cards in contact with the hands or fingers, aerials rely on momentum and precise movements to keep the cards airborne.</p>
                <p class="head-text">Aerials are often considered some of the most visually impressive and challenging moves in cardistry, requiring a high level of skill, dexterity, and timing to execute successfully. They can involve various throws, spins, flips, and catches, and they add an element of excitement and spectacle to cardistry performances.</p>

    <h2>1. Spring:</h2>
        <div class="subhead-items">
            <img class="subhead-column-display Image" src="images/aerials-spring.JPG">
        </div>
        <div class="subhead-items">
            <p>What is probably one of the most popular moves in cardistry, the Spring is a trick where all the cards in a deck are shot out of one hand, and caught by another. This trick is heavily based on what is most comfortable for you, as there is a lot of variety in how it can be performed. That being the case, I will show you the strategy that works best for me, and you can adjust as needed.</p>
        </div>



        <h3>Step 1:</h3>  
            <div class="subhead-items">  
                <p class="subhead-column-deats">Hold the deck in your dominant hand with your thumb on the bottom corner with the short side facing your thumb. On the opposite corner, across from your thumb, use your middle finger to suspend the deck in the air. Gently place your remaining fingers on the borders of the deck in a natural position. They will serve as borders to help guide the cards.</p>
                <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/aerials-spring1.JPG">
            </div>
            <div class="subhead-items">  
                <p class="subhead-column-deats">Hold your non-dominant hand beneath the deck, leaving room for the cards to “spring” from your first hand. Spread your fingers with your pinky serving as a guide to keep the cards from falling.</p>
                <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/aerials-spring2.JPG">
            </div>

        <h3>Step 2:</h3>  
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">With both hands in place, apply pressure on both sides of the deck using your thumb and middle finger on your dominant hand, this should arch the deck toward your palm. Next, slowly extend your thumb so that the cards are released consecutively.</p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/aerials-spring3.JPG">
        </div>
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">Using your other hand, catch the cards close to your dominant hand. As you improve, gradually move your hands apart until you can spring the cards from one hand to the other with increasing distance.</p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/aerials-spring4.JPG">
        </div>

    <h2>2. Dribble:</h2>
        <div class="subhead-items">

        </div>
        <div class="subhead-items">
            <p>The Dribble is a very similar move to the Spring, however, rather than springing the cards from one hand to the other, the Dribble consists of releasing the cards in a controlled fall that is useful in a variety of different tricks such as Anaconda.</p>
        </div>



        <h3>Step 1:</h3>  
            <div class="subhead-items">  
                <p class="subhead-column-deats">Hold the deck in a modified <a href="grips.html#section4" style="font-size: 1.5vw; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 0.2vw;">End Grip</a> with your dominant hand. Place your thumb on one short side of the deck, your index finger extended applying downward pressure along the long side, and your ring and pinky fingers holding the short side opposite to your thumb.</p>

            <div class="subhead-items">  
                <p>Tip: hold the deck with the tips of your fingers to release the cards more easily.</p>            </div>

        <h3>Step 2:</h3>  
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">While applying downward pressure with your index finger, gradually slide your thumb toward the base of your index finger, thus releasing the cards one by one into your non-dominant hand.</p>

            <p>The Card Flick is an excellent move to introduce you to the aerial realm of cardistry. Flicks are used in a variety of different tricks to add some flair to your moves.</p>
