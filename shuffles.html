                <p class="head-text">Shuffles serve as foundational moves that allow cardists to enhance their cardistry routines, improving the overall flow and aesthetic appeal of their performances. Shuffles add variety, rhythm, and complexity to cardistry routines, showcasing the skill and dexterity of the performer. Mastering various shuffles enables cardists to manipulate the cards with precision and creativity, unlocking endless possibilities for creating visually stunning effects and sequences.</p>

    <h2>1. Riffle Shuffle:</h2>
        <div class="subhead-items">

            <p>The Riffle Shuffle is a classic card shuffling technique that involves interweaving two halves of a deck of cards together. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a Riffle Shuffle:</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 1:</h3>  
            <div class="subhead-items">
                <p class="subhead-column-deats">Holding the deck in <a href="grips.html#section4" style="font-size: 1.5vw; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 0.2vw;">End Grip</a> along the short side in your dominant hand, apply downward pressure with your curved index finger while applying reverse upward pressure with your thumb, bending the cards slightly. Slowly allow your thumb to release the cards by moving your thumb further toward your index finger until you have separated the deck in half. This motion is known as riffling.</p>
                <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-riffle1.JPG">
            </div>

        <h3>Step 2:</h3>  
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">Using your dominant hand, place the released cards between your non-dominant hand’s curved index finger and your other three fingers curling along the exposed short side of the deck. Once your non-dominant fingers are holding the first packet, release these cards from your dominant hand, allowing your non-dominant thumb to grasp the opposite short end. By the end of this step, both hands should be in End Grip, with roughly half the deck in either hand.</p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-riffle2.JPG">
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3:</h3>  
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">Now, position your hands so that your thumbs are nearly touching, and repeat the riffling motion discussed in the first step with both of your hands.</p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-riffle3.JPG">
        </div>
        <div class="subhead-items">
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">Here, the cards in either packet will be released alternately, resulting in an overlap along the short side where your thumbs previously held each packet.</p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-riffle4.JPG">
        </div>

        <h3>Step 4:</h3>  
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">In the last step, place your thumbs on top of the area where both packets intertwine. Then, extend your curved index finger, and curl it along the short side with the remaining fingers. Once your fingers are in place, apply pressure with your fingers to arch both sides of the deck to make a bridge.</p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-riffle5.JPG">
        </div>
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">Finally, release the pressure from your fingers by extending all curved fingers (remember to keep your thumbs in place). With practice, this should result in the cards riffling together to form one complete pile in your hands.</p>

    <h2>1. Faro Shuffle:</h2>
        <div class="subhead-items">

        </div>
        <div class="subhead-items">
            <p>The faro shuffle is a technique used to perfectly interweave two halves of a deck of cards together. It's often used in cardistry to perform visual flourishes. Here's how to perform a faro shuffle:</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 1:</h3>  
            <div class="subhead-items">  
                <p class="subhead-column-deats">Hold the deck in a modified <a href="grips.html#section2" style="font-size: 1.5vw; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 0.2vw;">Straddle Grip</a> (most often with your non-dominant hand), with your index finger curled beneath the deck.</p>
                <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro1.JPG">
            </div>
            <div class="subhead-items">
                <p class="subhead-column-deats">Using your dominant thumb, split the deck in half, then remove that half with your dominant hand. Make sure to grasp this half with your thumb along the long side, index along the top short side, and the remaining fingers on the opposite long side. </p>
                <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro2.JPG">
            </div>

        <h3>Step 2:</h3>  
            <div class="subhead-items">  
                <p class="subhead-column-deats">Once both hands are holding equal packets in the correct position, align the packets vertically with the dominant hand’s packet directly above the other so that both short sides are touching. Next, angle the top packet so that the face of the cards of your dominant hand is slightly angled behind the other packet. Additionally, angle the top packet towards you slightly so that only the corners of the packets are touching. </p>
                <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro3.JPG">
            </div>

                <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro4.JPG">
            </div>

        <h3>Step 3:</h3>  
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">With both packets fully in position, apply downward pressure to the top packet using your index finger. This process does not require much pressure and, if done correctly, will interweave the cards. Continue to apply pressure until all of the cards are weaved together, and the packets overlap by a couple of centimeters. </p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro.JPG">
        </div>

        <h3>Step 4:</h3>  
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">Once both packets are fully intertwined, release your dominant hand and grab both packets with your dominant hand’s thumb on the bottom short side and the rest of your dominant hand’s fingers on the opposite side short side. </p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro6.JPG">
        </div>

        <h3>Step 5: Optional</h3>
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-column-deats">Next, apply pressure with your dominant hand, toward your non-dominant hand creating an arch with both packets.</p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro7.JPG">
        </div>
        <div class="subhead-items">
            <p>Finally, release the fingers of your non-dominant hand, keeping them open to catch the cards, and the cards will riffle into one pile. </p>
            <img class="subhead-column-img Image" src="images/shuffles-faro8.JPG">
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="subhead-items">  
            <p class="subhead-items">The Faro Shuffle is an advanced shuffle that takes a lot of time and practice to master. Don’t fear if you cannot complete it immediately, some decks take more time than others to discover the pressure required to properly Faro the cards. However, not all cards have the ability to Faro. To know which decks can Faro, examine the deck or the box to see if the deck has an "air-cushion finish" or dimples along the face and top. If the deck does have these, it is likely able to faro.</p>
